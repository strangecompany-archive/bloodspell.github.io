Many years ago, he wrote several articles on writing and related subjects for machinima.com.</p>		  <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/registry/registry.html/203-6773446-6219958?%5Fencoding=UTF8&amp;type=wishlist&amp;id=MRVCNFO8GLIO">Alasdair Watson`s wishlist</a>

He is perhaps best known for his series of  tutorials which helped other filmmakers break into the genre in 1998-99.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only BloodSpell collaborator on the western side of the Atlantic, he brings 15 years of sound engineering and composition experience to this project.
