1
00:00:06,097 --> 00:00:07,026
What are they?

2
00:00:07,437 --> 00:00:09,990
The unclean, who will be
delivered unto the Angels.

3
00:00:11,082 --> 00:00:11,629
But they aren't all-

4
00:00:11,629 --> 00:00:13,430
They have all been tested.

5
00:00:13,683 --> 00:00:14,500
But that girl's-

6
00:00:15,138 --> 00:00:15,842
She's not-

7
00:00:16,946 --> 00:00:18,797
She's the one they were going to sacrifice!

8
00:00:19,128 --> 00:00:21,590
That girl is the reason they were gathered.

9
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:24,900
The ceremony was her initiation
as a Blood Witch.

10
00:00:25,895 --> 00:00:31,463
If the Church knew of your power,
you would be in those cages with them.

11
00:00:31,736 --> 00:00:34,885
Another filthy Blooded to be cleansed.

12
00:00:36,223 --> 00:00:38,086
You have been lucky, boy.

13
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,224
Luckier than she was.

14
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:55,413
Nervous?

15
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,078
The cages - They're-

16
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:00,027
There's nothing they can do to us.

17
00:02:50,263 --> 00:02:52,166
Are they going to hurt us?

18
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,165
Gad will kill them.

19
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,572
But we'll be okay?

20
00:02:55,263 --> 00:02:56,816
Hush, now.

21
00:03:03,468 --> 00:03:09,221
On this blessed day, we are here to witness
the greatest of all the Angels' blessings -

22
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:19,920
the miracle of cleansing, whereby these poor,
sad, degenerate creatures, tainted by the
impurity in their blood, are made whole.

23
00:03:20,545 --> 00:03:29,425
It is a sign of our Angels' pure Light, of their
Mercy, that we impious souls are given their
blessing and the work of their hands.

24
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:36,416
Though we have strayed from their path, they
welcome us back from the shadows, if only
we will repent of our sins,

25
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:40,991
and offer up to them those whose nature
has stained them beyond salvation.

26
00:03:43,017 --> 00:03:44,262
Jered?

27
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:50,678
Don't want to interrupt your prayers, son.
Just wanted to say that we're all proud of you.

28
00:03:50,822 --> 00:03:54,456
Who'd have thought that an orphan
boy would come this far, eh?

29
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:55,439
Captain...

30
00:03:55,592 --> 00:03:56,396
Yes, son?

31
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:58,078
That girl...

32
00:03:59,054 --> 00:04:00,660
She's not one of them.

33
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:04,623
Sorry, son. They've all been pricked.
She is.

34
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,480
But she's not a...

35
00:04:08,993 --> 00:04:11,169
But she's not deformed.

36
00:04:11,504 --> 00:04:13,263
She's not a monster.

37
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:18,238
The Angels know the truth.
It's not our place to question them-

38
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,079
No!

39
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,115
It's difficult-

40
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:21,699
It's not difficult!

41
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:24,358
It's wrong!

42
00:04:24,734 --> 00:04:27,393
I order you to stop this!

43
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:31,939
Two hours' time from now you can
order me into the gates of Hell, Jered. 

44
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:34,636
Before that you have to bow to the Angel.

45
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:38,044
So you should be thinking about your sins,
not this pretty witch.

46
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,321
The Captain's right.
The Master knows what he's doing.

47
00:04:54,435 --> 00:04:56,506
And anyway, what could we do?

48
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:02,243
(gasps)

49
00:05:03,252 --> 00:05:06,300
I said...
I'd save her.

50
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,370
BOWMEN!

51
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:27,715
Stop this, Jered!
Don't make it worse!

52
00:05:32,245 --> 00:05:33,928
It could have been me.

53
00:05:36,927 --> 00:05:37,546
No!

54
00:05:54,051 --> 00:06:00,838
(screams)

55
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:05,259
Come on!  Run!

56
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,418
'Ware the boy! Don't let him escape!
