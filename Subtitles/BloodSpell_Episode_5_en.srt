1
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:14,292
What are you doing?

2
00:00:14,724 --> 00:00:16,011
I'm not going to the cathedral!

3
00:00:16,103 --> 00:00:17,669
Get away from her, whelp!

4
00:00:20,384 --> 00:00:23,308
I said I'd save her.

5
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:34,118
You're that fellow the monks are chasing!

6
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:35,015
In here!

7
00:00:38,243 --> 00:00:39,463
Where did he go?

8
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:40,033
Uh?

9
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:41,851
The heretic.

10
00:00:42,386 --> 00:00:43,082
Answer me!

11
00:00:43,271 --> 00:00:45,347
He's in my bed.

12
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:51,975
Clean yourself up, degenerate.

13
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:03,927
Old Hendrick's had that wing closed off for
months.  The floor's not safe.

14
00:01:03,927 --> 00:01:05,007
Thank you.

15
00:01:05,411 --> 00:01:08,574
Anything to hinder the enemies of wine and freedom!

16
00:01:09,285 --> 00:01:10,301
There's clothes in there.

17
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,212
Sorry.  Feeling a bit...

18
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,151
(blurgh) (hwork)

19
00:01:14,216 --> 00:01:15,486
(blargle)(horp)

20
00:01:39,286 --> 00:01:41,576
Come on, come on...

21
00:01:42,698 --> 00:01:43,354
Carrie?

22
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:44,350
Where's Arianne?

23
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:47,140
She's out hunting the blood
eaters in the Old Quarter.

24
00:01:47,698 --> 00:01:50,514
We've been hearing all sorts –
what happened? Are you alright?

25
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:53,458
We ran away when the bastards'
ceremony blew up on them,

26
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,881
and I've spent the rest of the evening
hiding in rubbish heaps with...

27
00:01:57,474 --> 00:01:58,220
...the kid.

28
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,362
I'm Bram!

29
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:00,823
(sigh)
Whatever.

30
00:02:00,823 --> 00:02:01,822
Hello, Bram.

31
00:02:02,708 --> 00:02:06,661
I heard that there was some kind of rebellion–
one of the Black Monks turned on the Church?

32
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,713
If that's true, it's could change everything.

33
00:02:09,789 --> 00:02:13,189
Yes, because of course one boy's going
to change the whole Church-

34
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:14,757
Who he works for, by the way-

35
00:02:14,757 --> 00:02:16,480
But when you were doing your
big spell in the cave-

36
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,948
You're getting cold.  Go and sit by the fire.

37
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:19,920
I'm not cold.

38
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:21,511
Fire.  Now.

39
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:23,454
So this-

40
00:02:23,454 --> 00:02:26,348
Anyway, how's my uncle?
Did-  Did he escape?

41
00:02:26,368 --> 00:02:29,205
Gad?  Yes, he's fine. He got out in the raid.

42
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:32,011
Been drinking himself unconcious ever since.

43
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:33,739
Worrying about you, mostly.

44
00:02:33,853 --> 00:02:36,208
Well, I couldn't exactly dump the
baggage, could I?

45
00:02:37,744 --> 00:02:38,610
You know whose he is?

46
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:40,173
We'll find them.

47
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:41,431
Good.

48
00:02:41,442 --> 00:02:44,843
Then I really need a serious wash
and some actual clothes-

49
00:02:44,843 --> 00:02:45,464
Carrie.

50
00:02:46,176 --> 00:02:50,135
This monk – he went up against the church?
Saved you?

51
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:56,445
YES! Yes, alright, this Jered guy,
he jumped up on stage,

52
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,033
he attacked the guards,
and nearly killed himself...

53
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:03,428
And it was brave and it was noble
and I'm certain he thought he was saving me...

54
00:03:03,428 --> 00:03:06,317
...even in the cellar-
and he saved my life!

55
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:08,853
So he's a total idiot!

56
00:03:12,255 --> 00:03:14,132
Do you-  Do you think he got away?

57
00:03:14,238 --> 00:03:18,721
Maybe.
He was running for his life last I saw him.

58
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,903
Away from everything he knows.

59
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:22,934
Poor man.

60
00:05:05,401 --> 00:05:06,644
What can I get you?

61
00:05:07,248 --> 00:05:08,781
I- I need to find the Blooded.

62
00:05:08,986 --> 00:05:10,162
Don't know what you're talking about.

63
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:11,812
I know they meet here.

64
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:15,748
I need a place to hide.

65
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,546
I'm a blood mage.

66
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:22,070
Sure you are, kid.

67
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,076
Take this, and sit yourself down-
before you get hurt.

68
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:31,306
If you don't help me...
It won't be me who gets hurt!

69
00:05:34,705 --> 00:05:36,469
Take the drink.

70
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:47,781
Mind if I sit down?

71
00:05:48,204 --> 00:05:48,863
Why?

72
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,765
Seems like you're in a spot of
trouble, if I heard you right.

73
00:05:53,765 --> 00:05:58,288
Now, now, don't get yourself in a
knot.  I might be able to help.

74
00:05:59,476 --> 00:06:00,316
Go on.

75
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:05,323
You are - what you said – right?

76
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,139
Yes.

77
00:06:06,247 --> 00:06:08,103
What brings you down here?

78
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:09,544
The Church.

79
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:13,527
Well, you're in a dangerous way, then.

80
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:16,344
Lucky for you I-

81
00:06:16,344 --> 00:06:17,212
You!

82
00:06:18,292 --> 00:06:21,112
How dare you come in here, you little bastard?

83
00:06:21,202 --> 00:06:22,967
Now, man, he's not doing anything wrong-

84
00:06:22,967 --> 00:06:24,523
He's a Church dog!

85
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:26,028
Look!

86
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:26,823
Get off me!

87
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:31,885
I'm here because I helped you damn people!

88
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,078
You filth took our children!

89
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,229
You took my arm!

90
00:06:35,385 --> 00:06:37,036
It didn't happen like that!

91
00:06:37,036 --> 00:06:39,046
You gave my niece to the angels!

92
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:39,656
No!

93
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,522
No, that's not true!

94
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,284
She's alive!

95
00:06:53,123 --> 00:06:55,290
No.  Let him go.

96
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,776
Killing him won't change anything.

97
00:07:06,943 --> 00:07:07,986
Lucky escape.

98
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:10,410
Drive you out of house and home, did they?

99
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:13,360
Lets just say I can't go back to my job.

100
00:07:14,318 --> 00:07:16,788
Haven't you got no family to hide you?

101
00:07:17,718 --> 00:07:18,705
I'm an orphan.

102
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,325
Well, ain't that a pity.

103
00:07:21,785 --> 00:07:24,763
Family's important. I've always said that.

104
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:27,284
You've got to provide for your family.

105
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,258
You've got the magic in your blood.

106
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:34,259
When you spill it, the magic comes out.

107
00:07:34,804 --> 00:07:36,500
Lot of people want a piece of that.

108
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,801
And you stink of it.

109
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:44,905
Want to wash that off?

110
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:46,996
Thank you for all your help.

111
00:07:51,578 --> 00:07:52,783
My pleasure.

112
00:07:55,397 --> 00:07:56,466
Uh, hello?

113
00:07:58,185 --> 00:08:00,418
Uh, I need to wash some blood-

114
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:01,949
Blood?

115
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:02,953
(sniffs)

116
00:08:02,953 --> 00:08:05,871
Smell the blood.

117
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:10,014
It's powerful...

118
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,352
Get away from me!

119
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,976
Argh!

120
00:08:17,316 --> 00:08:19,140
I-  I can't move!

121
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:20,610
What have you done to me?

122
00:08:23,892 --> 00:08:26,801
You drinks the blood.

123
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,193
You likes the blood.

124
00:08:31,891 --> 00:08:34,525
Makes you strong.
