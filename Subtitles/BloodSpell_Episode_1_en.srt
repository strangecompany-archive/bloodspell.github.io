1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,585
If a man is known to carry sorcery in his blood...

2
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:14,448
Or if he may divine...

3
00:00:14,265 --> 00:00:18,333
Or call devils to do his bidding by the
spilling of that blood...

4
00:00:18,512 --> 00:00:21,613
Then he is an abomination in the sight of the Angels.

5
00:00:22,112 --> 00:00:25,000
All who follow the light shall shun him...

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,540
And bring him before the Angels for his
judgement and cleansing.

7
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,929
Angel's guard!
Open up!

8
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,134
Don't let him get to the ... URGH!

9
00:01:34,622 --> 00:01:36,327
Strengthen the guard at the entrance.

10
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:37,261
Brother Carrin...

11
00:01:37,778 --> 00:01:39,302
Find the other exits to this hole.

12
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:41,037
- But..
- Get on it!


13
00:01:42,754 --> 00:01:44,389
With your permission, of course...

14
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:45,480
...Sir.

15
00:01:47,435 --> 00:01:50,649
Brother, I'm... I'm not sure that-

16
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,669
Do you have an order, sir?

17
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:57,701
Yes, yes. We don't have the men to scout right now.


18
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,811
Keep everyone in a tight group.

19
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:02,399
Are you sure that's wise, sir?

20
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,364
I'm in charge, brother.  Do it.

21
00:02:08,695 --> 00:02:12,333
(laughs)
Very good. You passed that test.

22
00:02:13,009 --> 00:02:15,668
That was the first time you fought a
blood mage, wasn't it?

23
00:02:16,117 --> 00:02:17,010
Yes, Captain.

24
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:21,428
When we go in, you leave the mages to
the experienced brothers.

25
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,681
You'll order two parties of guardsmen. 

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,153
One to contain and seperate the leaders...

27
00:02:27,559 --> 00:02:29,612
Gad of the Iron Arm and Arianne ...

28
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,299
We have to move!  Now!

29
00:03:05,848 --> 00:03:08,272
- Have they heard us?
- They're going to kill that girl!

30
00:03:08,273 --> 00:03:10,542
Quaen, get the crossbowmen to come-

31
00:03:10,543 --> 00:03:11,732
What did I tell you?

32
00:03:12,522 --> 00:03:14,089
Pay up, bother.  Five marks.

33
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:15,590
What?

34
00:03:15,591 --> 00:03:17,080
They're Blooded, Jered!

35
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:19,932
They stab girls.
They summon demons.

36
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,701
On their day off, they kill cute little puppies, business as-

37
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,740
You don't understand, brother!

38
00:03:24,741 --> 00:03:26,833
The girl's still alive - for now!

39
00:03:27,102 --> 00:03:30,369
- There are fifteen Blooded in there.
- I can see that.

40
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,928
And Gad's leading them!

41
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,555
Gad of the Iron Arm!

42
00:03:33,556 --> 00:03:37,908
I've seen him break a man in two with one
blow from that device...

43
00:03:37,864 --> 00:03:40,155
She's going to die, Quaen.

44
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,315
And we're sworn to-

45
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:46,143
If you want to die for some Blooded whore,
you go right ahead.

46
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,866
But I'm not getting killed...

47
00:03:47,917 --> 00:03:49,521
Because you want some blood on your staff.

48
00:03:49,902 --> 00:03:51,497
I have command!

49
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:53,895
We're going in. Now.

50
00:03:54,372 --> 00:03:57,399
You are only in command as a training exercise.

51
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,351
The Master did appoint him-

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,036
You fail!
Get out of my sight!

53
00:04:02,455 --> 00:04:03,386
And do what?

54
00:04:03,177 --> 00:04:04,506
I don't care.

55
00:04:04,813 --> 00:04:06,061
Go be a hero.

56
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:08,944
Remiel, bless me.

57
00:04:08,945 --> 00:04:10,994
As I go to your battle.

58
00:04:18,902 --> 00:04:19,812
What?

59
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:22,370
Who the hell are you?

60
00:04:22,934 --> 00:04:25,594
Jered. I'm a monk of the Angels.

61
00:04:25,595 --> 00:04:27,145
Let the girl go.

62
00:04:28,323 --> 00:04:32,106
Half of this room can kill you by cutting
their wrists, lad.

63
00:04:32,177 --> 00:04:33,628
You don't want to die.

64
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,307
Let – the girl – go.

65
00:04:49,296 --> 00:04:52,682
LET HER GO!

66
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:57,903
Tick, Brainpan, check the back.

67
00:04:57,904 --> 00:04:58,813
Might be a trap.

68
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:15,072
You shouldn't have come here.

69
00:05:15,489 --> 00:05:17,765
The Blood have to protect their own.

70
00:05:35,989 --> 00:05:38,254
I had everything completely
under control.

71
00:05:38,824 --> 00:05:40,319
We do our duty, Jered.

72
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:43,677
I'm going to send you home
in pieces, "Brother".

73
00:05:43,678 --> 00:05:47,292
Crossbows, take the tainted!
Center, maces ready!

74
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,535
Try it!

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,546
Your lad's going to get you killed.

76
00:06:14,547 --> 00:06:16,242
You should have sent someone older.

77
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:18,528
They did.  I'm still following the lad.

78
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:39,479
Peace, child.

79
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,190
It will soon be over.

80
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:43,313
Follow me!

81
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:01,555
That's not possible-

82
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:08,014
Don't worry.
You'll be out of this soon.

83
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,552
Wh- Who are you?

84
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:11,119
My name's Jered.

85
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,620
I'm with-

86
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:18,289
Don't move, Jered!
