1
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,384
I'm with-

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:10,926
Don't move, Jered!

3
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,634
I'm trying to rescue you!

4
00:00:14,146 --> 00:00:16,837
No-one touches my family.

5
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:24,763
Find Gad!

6
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:27,297
The man with the iron arm!

7
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,393
I thought so.

8
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,403
Your witch can't save you now.

9
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,005
Goodbye, traitor.

10
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,480
And the Demoncaller?

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,273
Still secure on the Spire, Master.

12
00:00:56,562 --> 00:00:58,199
All his information was accurate.

13
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,967
Very well.  He will remain useful for a while longer.

14
00:01:02,252 --> 00:01:03,454
Her companions?

15
00:01:03,454 --> 00:01:05,291
We've got the woman here, Master.

16
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,723
The tattooed boy we left for dead.

17
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:08,844
Tattooed?

18
00:01:09,298 --> 00:01:12,064
Aye, my lord. A boy who fought like a monk.

19
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:15,014
Either a traitor, or trained by traitors.

20
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:17,398
Dealt with him proper.

21
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:17,927
How?

22
00:01:18,488 --> 00:01:21,633
Well, M- Master, he was with the woman, so I -

23
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:24,123
What did you do?

24
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,714
Brother Anoslus pitched him out of the-

25
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,501
I- I didn't see in time, Master.

26
00:01:31,903 --> 00:01:33,246
You will take me to where this happened.

27
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:34,057
Now!

28
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,319
Take Anolsus and put him in the black cell.

29
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:42,315
No Master, please!

30
00:01:42,687 --> 00:01:43,370
What did I d-

31
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,222
(door slams)

32
00:01:46,706 --> 00:01:48,514
Where would the boy have gone?

33
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,441
If he had-

34
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,048
The woman shouted to him, Master.

35
00:01:51,048 --> 00:01:52,966
Something about a man named 'Gad'.

36
00:01:53,292 --> 00:01:54,416
Gad?

37
00:01:56,919 --> 00:02:00,321
Then we should expect a rescue attempt...

38
00:02:00,356 --> 00:02:03,683
(horrible screams)

39
00:03:06,097 --> 00:03:08,332
Master safe...

40
00:03:10,597 --> 00:03:12,294
(groans)

41
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,985
Oh, Light...

42
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:16,574
Arianne!

43
00:03:34,029 --> 00:03:36,331
Hey!  Gie'us fifty on the big man!

44
00:03:36,386 --> 00:03:41,028
Naaaaaah, man!  Twenty on the wee radge
bastard!  He's more bitter, by the way!

45
00:03:43,726 --> 00:03:44,466
Hey!

46
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,498
What are you doing here?

47
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,438
I work here.

48
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:52,780
What are you doing here, choirboy?

49
00:03:53,173 --> 00:03:55,241
A woman named Arianne sent me here.

50
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,436
I have to find your uncle.

51
00:03:57,385 --> 00:03:58,197
Gad!?

52
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,615
He wants to take your head off.

53
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:01,936
Well, yes, no doubt.

54
00:04:02,511 --> 00:04:03,725
But I have to find him.

55
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:06,669
Well...  You should see him.

56
00:04:06,769 --> 00:04:09,535
It's your fault, what's happened.

57
00:04:09,535 --> 00:04:11,361
What?  What has happened?

58
00:04:11,563 --> 00:04:13,354
You Churchmen happened.

59
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:15,564
See for yourself.

60
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:41,334
(cheering crowd)

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,676
(gong sounds)

62
00:04:42,910 --> 00:05:00,161
(cheering crowd)

63
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,839
Marrog's a brute.

64
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:05,448
With his arm, my uncle would
have torn him to pieces.

65
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,345
But you people have it now, don't you.

66
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,354
I don't think they're my people anymore.

67
00:05:11,873 --> 00:05:13,111
Whatever.

68
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,343
He's going to get himself killed.

69
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,712
He's with me.

70
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:25,694
Gad.

71
00:05:26,672 --> 00:05:28,439
Arianne's been taken by the Church.

72
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,397
And why do you care, boy?

73
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:32,137
She saved my life.

74
00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:33,048
And she-

75
00:05:33,643 --> 00:05:34,646
She helped me.

76
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,474
Oh?  Yes?

77
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:37,980
She needs your help, Gad.

78
00:05:39,603 --> 00:05:42,223
You picked the wrong time to change sides, lad.

79
00:05:43,474 --> 00:05:47,584
I'd give my last breath to help Arianne,
but I'm not gonna be there.

80
00:05:47,544 --> 00:05:48,499
Uncle-

81
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,291
Nothing's gonna change, love.

82
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:54,486
Arianne's more important than some pit fight!

83
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,523
Nothing is more important than my word.

84
00:06:00,178 --> 00:06:00,920
Sorry, lad.

85
00:06:02,342 --> 00:06:04,180
Good luck to you, and the wench.

86
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:08,058
Uncle...  You can refuse to fight.

87
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,204
The crowd won't-

88
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:10,738
I won't run again!

89
00:06:12,883 --> 00:06:13,886
Get out of here.

90
00:06:16,573 --> 00:06:18,763
Damn it.  Arianne's-

91
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:20,326
Screw Arianne.

92
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:22,196
He's going to die.

93
00:06:22,652 --> 00:06:23,755
No he isn't.

94
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:25,395
Come on.
