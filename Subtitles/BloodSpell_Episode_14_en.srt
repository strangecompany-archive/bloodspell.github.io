1
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:08,628
Who the hell are you?

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:09,786
Jered.

3
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:11,741
I'm a monk of the Angels.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,699
I'm not going to the cathedral.

5
00:00:14,049 --> 00:00:15,066
I'm trying to rescue you!

6
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:21,837
“All who follow the Light shall shun him,
and bring him before the Angels for his
judgement and cleansing.”

7
00:00:23,868 --> 00:00:25,462
It's wrong!

8
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:29,398
Don't let him escape!

9
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,683
You will bring him to Me, will you not?

10
00:00:36,874 --> 00:00:39,330
How dare you come in here, you little bastard?

11
00:00:53,895 --> 00:00:54,534
All right.

12
00:00:56,438 --> 00:00:57,127
You win.

13
00:00:58,178 --> 00:00:59,679
I'll come back.

14
00:01:06,855 --> 00:01:08,881
Oh faithful servant...

15
00:01:09,686 --> 00:01:12,267
Bring to Me My sacrifice.

16
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,385
Lord...

17
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:21,979
Say what is your will.

18
00:01:22,272 --> 00:01:24,116
There are three here to be chosen.

19
00:01:24,348 --> 00:01:29,333
Bring forward to Me the one who
spilled his life on our altar.

20
00:01:30,136 --> 00:01:31,017
No.

21
00:01:31,447 --> 00:01:33,201
The man child.

22
00:01:36,024 --> 00:01:36,992
Lord...

23
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,050
Why not the others?

24
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:41,657
We will take who we will take.

25
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:45,115
Rather than him, would you not
prefer one who has...

26
00:01:45,115 --> 00:01:47,621
...hidden his fire in your sight for many years?

27
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,905
One who has defiled even your service?

28
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:50,756
Master!

29
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:57,306
Despite your flaws, you are a faithful servant.

30
00:01:57,812 --> 00:01:58,955
Now.

31
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:03,174
We will take the one who spilled fire on our altar.

32
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,071
No!

33
00:02:04,343 --> 00:02:06,558
You will heed our word.

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,482
You will not take my son!

35
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:44,278
You shall not fight this foe.

36
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:51,206
Come on, Jered!

37
00:02:52,703 --> 00:02:54,602
I release you from your word.  Go!

38
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,102
I've always wondered if you were quite
as immortal as you claim.

39
00:03:33,038 --> 00:03:33,920
Come on!

40
00:03:35,568 --> 00:03:36,336
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:38,627
He's alone up there.

42
00:03:53,964 --> 00:03:55,449
What are you doing?  Go!

43
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,229
I'm not going to-

44
00:03:57,569 --> 00:03:58,890
I'm not going to abandon you!

45
00:03:58,985 --> 00:04:00,104
Don't be a fool, boy!

46
00:04:01,131 --> 00:04:01,871
Run!

47
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:16,302
The blood!

48
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:17,701
Again, boy!  Now!

49
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:50,544
Master!

50
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:52,304
Run!

51
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,531
What!?

52
00:04:56,025 --> 00:04:57,331
It's not the blood, is it?

53
00:04:58,114 --> 00:04:59,139
It's my life.

54
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,773
You can only drink the blood if I try to hold on.

55
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:05,224
But if I let go...

56
00:05:05,429 --> 00:05:06,187
Jered!

57
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:08,286
I'll never let you have him!

58
00:05:18,272 --> 00:05:19,591
No!

59
00:05:20,129 --> 00:05:21,792
Noooooo-

60
00:05:33,758 --> 00:05:34,389
Close!

61
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:35,575
Damn you, close!

62
00:05:36,116 --> 00:05:37,030
Heal, Jered!

63
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:38,951
I command you, heal!

64
00:05:39,065 --> 00:05:40,117
Jered, live!

65
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,130
LIVE!

66
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:43,884
LIVE!

67
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,126
Jered...

68
00:05:47,517 --> 00:05:48,536
Please. 

69
00:05:49,124 --> 00:05:49,987
Jered.

70
00:05:54,672 --> 00:05:55,796
Leave him alone!

71
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:57,830
I...  I want...

72
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,418
He didn't spill his blood for you.

73
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,525
We shall spill our blood together...

74
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:10,394
...and by that joining we shall be made whole.

75
00:06:12,273 --> 00:06:12,920
What is it?

76
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:14,118
What are you-

77
00:06:14,532 --> 00:06:15,745
The initiation!

78
00:06:17,217 --> 00:06:19,810
Or, if our blood is not strong enough...

79
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:21,088
...we may die.

80
00:06:25,614 --> 00:06:27,893
Black monks killed my parents!

81
00:06:28,206 --> 00:06:29,295
My friends!

82
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:32,554
People die.

83
00:06:33,105 --> 00:06:33,645
No!

84
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,036
You may not leave!

85
00:06:35,197 --> 00:06:35,825
I will-

86
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,451
Go, then.

87
00:06:40,392 --> 00:06:41,098
(cough)

88
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:43,164
C- Carrie...

89
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:50,225
We will spill our heart's blood together...

90
00:06:50,716 --> 00:06:53,234
..and by that joining we will both be made whole.

91
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,720
Or if that joining is not strong enough...

92
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:57,572
...we may die.

93
00:07:22,907 --> 00:07:23,737
Son?

94
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,214
Erm...

95
00:07:46,308 --> 00:07:48,884
It's great that we're all alright, like, but...

96
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:51,664
Well, the mountain is still falling down.

97
00:07:55,921 --> 00:07:56,803
Run?
