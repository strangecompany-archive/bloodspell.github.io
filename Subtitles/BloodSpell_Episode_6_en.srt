1
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:13,402
I need a place to hide.

2
00:00:13,403 --> 00:00:16,324
I'm a blood mage.

3
00:00:19,557 --> 00:00:21,405
I-  I can't move!

4
00:00:21,639 --> 00:00:22,885
What have you done to me?

5
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,104
You drinks the blood.

6
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:33,653
You likes the blood.

7
00:00:33,794 --> 00:00:37,015
Makes you strong.

8
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:55,708
(whimpers)

9
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:01,484
I wouldn't eat him.

10
00:01:01,815 --> 00:01:03,857
You don't know where he's been.

11
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,563
You'll be able to move in a moment.

12
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:31,802
Whatever they did...

13
00:01:32,348 --> 00:01:34,670
It's already wearing off.

14
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:36,314
Thank you.

15
00:01:36,885 --> 00:01:38,041
I mean, if you hadn't come then-

16
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,158
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:01:39,222 --> 00:01:40,521
Arianne.

18
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,923
Uh, Jered.

19
00:01:41,911 --> 00:01:44,111
So... Jered.

20
00:01:44,593 --> 00:01:46,445
Where are you sleeping tonight?

21
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,025
Morning.

22
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:23,734
Morning.

23
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:25,021
So.

24
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:26,312
What do you think?

25
00:02:26,654 --> 00:02:29,210
Well, he's pleased to see you.

26
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:33,682
I'm still not sure about this, Ari.
We only need to miss one-

27
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:35,645
Oh, sleeping beauty's up.

28
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,644
Then we won't miss anything.

29
00:02:37,874 --> 00:02:38,830
Lanni's that good.

30
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,297
Nice to be wanted.

31
00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:42,701
Aww, she's so hard to please.

32
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,615
Unlike some.

33
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:48,566
And so, we can take care of the walking
guardians, which just leaves-

34
00:02:48,566 --> 00:02:49,583
(coughs)

35
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,036
Where are my clothes?

36
00:02:51,803 --> 00:02:54,205
I don't know, I wasn't paying much attention.

37
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,251
I think that's his jerkin on the
wardrode, there.

38
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:57,775
Ah.

39
00:02:57,775 --> 00:02:58,986
Erm...

40
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,300
Do you think you could get it for me?

41
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,137
Oh, I couldn't.
Another woman's wardrobe.

42
00:03:05,308 --> 00:03:06,649
I can't reach up there.

43
00:03:09,113 --> 00:03:10,475
I'll tell you what, love.

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,518
Why don't we give you some new clothes?

45
00:03:15,532 --> 00:03:17,066
I'm really not sure about this.

46
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:34,740
You'll be fine.

47
00:03:35,404 --> 00:03:38,561
All you have to do is get us through
Karak's front door.

48
00:03:38,836 --> 00:03:39,667
That's it.

49
00:03:40,211 --> 00:03:41,424
But I need to find the Blooded.

50
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:42,731
Well, you've found them.

51
00:03:43,082 --> 00:03:45,524
And the Blooded are going to Karak's tower.

52
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:46,373
But-

53
00:03:46,373 --> 00:03:47,360
We're here.

54
00:03:48,483 --> 00:03:49,819
You'll be fine.

55
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:51,461
Just be confident.

56
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,038
He lives down there?

57
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:54,639
Obvious blood mage...

58
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:56,356
Dead blood mage.

59
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:02,612
Remember - blood mages are always
obsessed with their potency.

60
00:04:03,517 --> 00:04:05,145
It'll keep his mind off things.

61
00:04:27,261 --> 00:04:28,397
Can I help you, sir?

62
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,320
Urm...

63
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,582
I am...
the blood mage, Jered.

64
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:42,963
Uh, th-th-the great and... mighty
blood... mage... Jered, and I, uh, seek...

65
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:49,002
Ah, I DEMAND that you let me into this...
hovel, immediately!

66
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:50,585
Um.

67
00:04:50,816 --> 00:04:51,733
Mmm hmm.

68
00:04:53,407 --> 00:04:56,016
And why exactly is that, sir?

69
00:04:56,156 --> 00:04:58,773
Well.  Good question.

70
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:04,326
I, er...  Well, I wish to give the - your - master
the...

71
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:09,956
...benefit of my superior magical wisdom and
knowledge in the field of, uh...

72
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:12,766
Magic.

73
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:13,879
And things.

74
00:05:16,521 --> 00:05:17,916
Ah, I see.

75
00:05:20,013 --> 00:05:24,209
Well, since you are a mage of power...

76
00:05:24,751 --> 00:05:28,207
You will have no problems with
passing through the portal.

77
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:29,748
Is that right, sir.

78
00:05:37,117 --> 00:05:38,447
(sobs)

79
00:05:38,623 --> 00:05:39,408
Course not.

80
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:42,198
Out of interest...

81
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,566
What would happen if I wasn't of sufficient...

82
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:47,857
...power...

83
00:05:50,384 --> 00:05:51,577
...to pass through the portal?

84
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:55,537
Oh, well in that case, sir, I would tear your
flesh from your body and, uh...

85
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:58,741
Render your bones down to serve as my soup.

86
00:05:59,701 --> 00:06:00,318
Good!

87
00:06:00,424 --> 00:06:01,699
Good, good, good.

88
00:06:02,254 --> 00:06:03,628
Right.
