1
00:00:10,745 --> 00:00:11,549
Find Gad!

2
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:14,230
The man with the iron arm!

3
00:00:16,046 --> 00:00:17,353
Tell him what happened!

4
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:24,937
Marrog's a brute.

5
00:00:24,972 --> 00:00:28,591
With his arm, my uncle would
have torn him to pieces.

6
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,581
Uncle... You can refuse to fight.

7
00:00:33,959 --> 00:00:34,915
The crowd won't-

8
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:36,331
I won't run again!

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,620
He's going to die.

10
00:00:38,888 --> 00:00:40,025
No he isn't.

11
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:41,703
Come on.

12
00:00:42,763 --> 00:00:48,298
(cheering crowd)

13
00:00:48,687 --> 00:00:50,729
You can't approach the champion,
he's in critical pre-match-

14
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:51,537
Argh!

15
00:00:51,694 --> 00:00:53,645
(growls)

16
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,622
You can't fight the man with one arm.

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:57,933
Yeah?

18
00:00:59,014 --> 00:00:59,723
Yeah.

19
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,741
What will it take you not to fight him?

20
00:01:03,741 --> 00:01:06,481
Cash?  Jewels?  Women?

21
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:07,598
What are you doing?

22
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,564
I'll think of something.

23
00:01:10,462 --> 00:01:14,047
Marrog has women.  Has jewels.

24
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:16,642
You?  Gad's woman?

25
00:01:16,603 --> 00:01:20,155
Yes- No!  Ewwww!

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,420
Good.

27
00:01:21,788 --> 00:01:26,198
You scream loud when Marrog
tear his legs off.

28
00:01:26,198 --> 00:01:27,616
I'll kill you!

29
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:28,831
I'll fight you.

30
00:01:28,936 --> 00:01:30,146
What?

31
00:01:30,146 --> 00:01:31,089
What!?

32
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:34,896
He's old.  Tired.  I'm young and strong.

33
00:01:35,574 --> 00:01:36,861
I'll make a much better fight.

34
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:38,563
(snort)

35
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:40,320
No woman.

36
00:01:40,653 --> 00:01:43,824
Oh, come on.  You can see she's
got feelings for me.

37
00:01:44,057 --> 00:01:44,839
What!?

38
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:47,342
Play along, for goodness sake.

39
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:54,555
(crunching noises)

40
00:01:58,114 --> 00:02:03,520
He old.  Tough.  You young, and soft.

41
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:07,463
Fight me when you killed men.

42
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,751
Jered, don't!

43
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:53,372
(cheering crowd)

44
00:02:53,405 --> 00:02:58,390
Ladies and gentlemen, things of all
ages, the Spitted Bull is proud to
present to you...

45
00:02:58,390 --> 00:03:02,193
Friday Niiiiiiiiiight
Fight Niiiiiiiiight!

46
00:03:02,193 --> 00:03:06,185
I bring to you, in your red corner,
the challenger - Marrog!

47
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:17,517
At a mighty 9'2", 500lbs, he's killed
125 people, he's maimed 142, and he's
got 2 MIA!

48
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:19,982
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
still looking for those remains!

49
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:24,027
He is The Beast From The East!
Marrooooooog!

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:33,195
And in the red corner, we have
your champion.  At a mighty 6'2", and
250lbs - 35lbs less than normal...

51
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:38,131
...because he's thrown one arm away
to fight this beast - he is your
champion!

52
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,316
He is undefeated!

53
00:03:40,405 --> 00:03:44,313
He is Gaaaaaaaaaad!

54
00:03:44,456 --> 00:03:49,293
Let's get ready to
rumbuuuuuuuul!

55
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:51,446
(gong sounds)

56
00:03:55,683 --> 00:03:57,795
It is true.

57
00:03:58,043 --> 00:04:00,945
Your strength is all in metal arm.

58
00:04:01,138 --> 00:04:04,270
Marrog will kill you tonight.

59
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:06,153
A lot of people have said that to me.

60
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:09,633
But none of them were Marrog...

61
00:04:10,655 --> 00:04:14,584
If you bastards hadn't broken in,
it would all be fine.

62
00:04:14,584 --> 00:04:20,230
My uncle would still have his arm,
and even if he didn't, I'd be
able to save him.

63
00:04:21,077 --> 00:04:23,167
I didn't decide to raid there.

64
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:27,665
Of course you didn't, but for
some reason it happened anyway.

65
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,515
Can't you do anything?

66
00:04:33,548 --> 00:04:35,758
If I'd been initiated...

67
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:40,706
The way I am now, I can't make
the illusions real enough.

68
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,787
Marrog's too strong.

69
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,536
I need the power of another blood...

70
00:04:48,536 --> 00:04:50,069
...mage.

71
00:04:52,439 --> 00:04:54,672
(sighs) Not like that.

72
00:05:00,337 --> 00:05:03,816
I just want you to know -
I still hate you.

73
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,545
Take this.

74
00:05:14,789 --> 00:05:17,109
A lot of people have said that...
A lot of people have....

75
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,318
A lot of people...
A lot of people have said that to...
A lot of people....

76
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:24,259
A lot of people have said...
A lot of people have...
A lot of people have said that...

77
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,904
Huh?

78
00:06:09,794 --> 00:06:13,085
Uuuuurgh...

79
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:23,055
(cheering crowd)

80
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:25,420
Don't ever do that again, Carrie.

81
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,255
The circle's sacred.

82
00:06:27,255 --> 00:06:30,569
So you'd rather Marrog made
mincemeat of you, then?

83
00:06:37,578 --> 00:06:41,271
So now you want me to get killed
for Arianne instead?  Is that it lad?

84
00:06:41,254 --> 00:06:42,585
Not exactly.

85
00:06:43,426 --> 00:06:44,900
We are going to rescue Arianne.

86
00:06:45,262 --> 00:06:46,347
But first-

87
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,602
We're going to go and get your arm back.

88
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,625
Contact the Master.

89
00:07:13,877 --> 00:07:16,712
Tell him everything is proceeding as he has determined.
