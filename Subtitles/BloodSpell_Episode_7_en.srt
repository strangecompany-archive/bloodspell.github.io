1
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:25,745
Piracy is a crime.


2
00:00:25,745 --> 00:00:30,218
Piracy is a crime.
So please don't steal any boats.

3
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,030
I heard there was some
kind of rebellion.

4
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,574
That one of the black monks
turned on the church.

5
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:39,643
If that's true...

6
00:00:39,966 --> 00:00:41,259
It could change everything.

7
00:00:41,446 --> 00:00:42,497
I need a place to hide.

8
00:00:44,024 --> 00:00:45,366
I'm a blood mage.

9
00:00:46,452 --> 00:00:47,058
Aaargh!

10
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,426
All you have to do is get us through
Karak's front door.

11
00:00:52,867 --> 00:00:53,725
That's it.

12
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:58,160
What would happen if I wasn't of sufficient...

13
00:00:58,648 --> 00:00:59,343
...power...

14
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:03,142
...to pass through the portal?

15
00:01:03,706 --> 00:01:06,848
Oh, well in that case, sir, I would tear your
flesh from your body and, uh...

16
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:10,166
Render your bones down to serve as my soup.

17
00:01:11,082 --> 00:01:11,603
Good!

18
00:01:12,131 --> 00:01:12,964
Good, good, good.

19
00:01:14,134 --> 00:01:14,901
Right.

20
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:36,811
Welcome to the tower of Master Enchanter
Karak Demoncaller, sir.

21
00:01:37,643 --> 00:01:39,095
May I take your coat?

22
00:01:39,397 --> 00:01:40,077
No!

23
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,543
But bring my, er...

24
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:44,653
...assistants through, please.

25
00:01:45,291 --> 00:01:48,173
I shall attend to it momentarily, sir.

26
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:54,151
I note they are all women, sir.

27
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:55,683
Yes.

28
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:57,939
Yes, they are.

29
00:02:03,014 --> 00:02:04,184
Glaaargh!

30
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,083
What are you doing!?

31
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:07,104
Yes, what *are* you doing?

32
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:11,707
Oh, I see. You want Karak Demoncaller
to get a full report-

33
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,678
The hell with this, I'm not staying
here with murderers!

34
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,343
You can't leave.

35
00:02:16,509 --> 00:02:17,255
Yeah?

36
00:02:17,582 --> 00:02:18,655
Why?

37
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:20,104
No door.

38
00:02:24,596 --> 00:02:26,007
What are you really doing here?

39
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:28,691
Always picks the smart ones...

40
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,462
We're stealing-

41
00:02:31,462 --> 00:02:32,318
Shut up, Lanni.

42
00:02:32,499 --> 00:02:35,308
Karak trades with the Blood Eaters,
among other things.

43
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:37,003
Your friends from the cellar.

44
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:40,716
I'm sorry about what just happened.

45
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,423
But we have to take some things from him.

46
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:47,437
Do  you really want him having them instead?

47
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,588
How can I trust you?

48
00:02:49,823 --> 00:02:51,665
Because I'm not lying, Jered.

49
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:53,843
Alright.

50
00:02:56,347 --> 00:02:58,293
Would that work if I tried it?

51
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,166
Not in a million years.

52
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:05,463
Stairwell's this way.

53
00:03:42,285 --> 00:03:42,861
Stop.

54
00:03:46,815 --> 00:03:48,777
So, have you heard anything of the Black Monks?

55
00:03:49,323 --> 00:03:52,029
You've been travelling a lot lately, in the open.

56
00:03:52,152 --> 00:03:55,367
I know. They'll make their move eventually.

57
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,739
But you can't hide away forever.

58
00:03:58,078 --> 00:03:59,869
Round the side here, now.

59
00:03:59,977 --> 00:04:01,140
And carefully.

60
00:04:20,801 --> 00:04:22,789
Well.  This is cosy.

61
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,952
It's probably another blood trigger.

62
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,892
You're up, sweetie.

63
00:04:27,205 --> 00:04:28,928
We've only got one blood mage.

64
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:31,157
No sense to risk him.

65
00:04:31,655 --> 00:04:32,804
I'll do it.

66
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,961
Is that wise?

67
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,153
Of course not.

68
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:39,086
What do you reckon?
P for 'password'?

69
00:04:39,086 --> 00:04:41,973
It could be anything, if he's as clever as that.

70
00:04:43,193 --> 00:04:44,234
I should go.

71
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:47,654
They're never as clever as they look...

72
00:04:48,383 --> 00:04:52,674
I'll wager it's either 'password' or...

73
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:55,783
His name.

74
00:04:56,739 --> 00:04:57,701
Told you.

75
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:03,921
Well, now.

76
00:05:04,238 --> 00:05:05,215
That isn't good.

77
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:34,907
Aren't you going to run out there after her?

78
00:05:36,157 --> 00:05:37,396
We need to solve the riddle!

79
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,104
Blood!

80
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,298
Spell out 'blood'!

81
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:33,520
No!

82
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,181
He tied the traps to blood magic.

83
00:07:00,283 --> 00:07:02,774
You're right.  I should have gone first.

84
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,103
Yes.  You should.

85
00:07:05,978 --> 00:07:06,671
Come on.

86
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,382
It's safe.

87
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,137
Remiel's name!

88
00:07:36,416 --> 00:07:37,835
Come on!

89
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:53,540
There now.

90
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:55,662
Don't you look pretty.

91
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,121
Your fee.

92
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,484
As agreed.

93
00:08:08,844 --> 00:08:09,718
What the hell!

94
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:11,355
This isn't-

95
00:08:12,203 --> 00:08:13,397
Lanni...

96
00:08:13,699 --> 00:08:14,426
Why?

97
00:08:15,516 --> 00:08:17,898
You know her, and you have to ask that?

98
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:21,161
Patronising, selfish bitch.

99
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:24,297
I'd have done it for free.

100
00:08:25,614 --> 00:08:26,865
I'll find you.

101
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:33,109
You'll find nothing but your death, witch.

102
00:08:38,797 --> 00:08:39,417
Go.

103
00:08:39,702 --> 00:08:40,506
No way.

104
00:08:40,739 --> 00:08:43,862
She alone has offended the Angels.
The rest of you, leave.

105
00:08:44,347 --> 00:08:45,679
I'm not going anywhere.

106
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:47,213
Then your actions damn you.

107
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,137
Tarreg, Gendon, the woman.

108
00:08:48,972 --> 00:08:50,219
Guards, the boy.

109
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:51,975
I'll deal with the witch.

110
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,145
Go.

111
00:08:57,145 --> 00:08:59,076
I need you to warn the others.

112
00:09:06,157 --> 00:09:07,138
Find Gad!

113
00:09:08,094 --> 00:09:09,892
The man with the iron arm.

114
00:09:11,732 --> 00:09:12,997
Tell him what happened.

115
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,975
Who are you, lad?

116
00:09:21,324 --> 00:09:22,597
You're good.

117
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:30,643
Ugh!

118
00:09:33,324 --> 00:09:34,402
Shona!

119
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:35,232
Ooof!

120
00:09:38,648 --> 00:09:40,110
I thought so.

121
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:51,455
Your witch can't save you now.

122
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:55,665
Goodbye, traitor.
