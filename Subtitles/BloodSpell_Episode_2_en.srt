1
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,048
What are you doing!?

2
00:00:04,532 --> 00:00:06,295
I'm not going to the cathedral.

3
00:00:06,866 --> 00:00:08,006
You'll be safe- Ow!

4
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:11,212
I'm trying to rescue you!

5
00:00:11,212 --> 00:00:12,022
Oh yes?

6
00:00:12,022 --> 00:00:14,176
And were you rescuing Magda, too?

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,306
Who?

8
00:00:15,403 --> 00:00:17,237
The woman you just killed!

9
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:27,163
Get moving, choirboy.

10
00:00:27,317 --> 00:00:31,774
You really think a knife can stop me?
I could-

11
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:36,875
Go on, then!  Beat me up!
Take me prisoner!  Rescue me!

12
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:40,458
Alright.

13
00:00:42,544 --> 00:00:43,865
Where are we going?

14
00:00:47,538 --> 00:00:48,367
NO!

15
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:50,707
You idiot!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
We have to go, sir!

17
00:01:01,916 --> 00:01:03,886
Get away from her, whelp!

18
00:01:12,468 --> 00:01:15,418
No-one touches my family.

19
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,149
You're screwed, lad.

20
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:23,043
No...

21
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:23,942
No...

22
00:01:24,948 --> 00:01:28,062
And I can spill your blood all I want.

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:03,710
(screams)
(tearing noises)

24
00:03:32,477 --> 00:03:34,238
How's the hero of the hour, then?

25
00:03:34,657 --> 00:03:35,522
The-  What?

26
00:03:35,557 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, come on!  Capturing Gad's Iron Arm,
taking charge from Quaen - they were whispering
about you at mass, man!

27
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Oh.

28
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,608
Really?

29
00:03:44,922 --> 00:03:47,580
Sounds like being the Master's favourite
is hard work.

30
00:03:48,044 --> 00:03:48,601
Well-

31
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:49,163
Hey!

32
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,810
Master.

33
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,436
Novice Arran.

34
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,334
Novice Jered.

35
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Walk with me a moment, Novice Jered.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Thank you for sending me with the raid,
Master.  Arran says it went well.

37
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ah.  He does, does he?

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm very sorry if I made any mistakes.

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Mistakes?

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I didn't mean to-

41
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,729
What in Hell possessed you, boy!?

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,750
You showed your blood magic!

43
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,987
I didn't have a choice, Master!
I would have died.

44
00:04:22,987 --> 00:04:26,795
So you didn't choose to ignore Brother
Quaen?  A good man, by the way.

45
00:04:26,795 --> 00:04:29,620
You didn't choose to abandon a plan
I had sanctioned?

46
00:04:29,655 --> 00:04:32,565
Things changed, Master!
They were going to kill someone!

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,147
And the Angel tells us to defend the
innocents, doesn't it?

48
00:04:37,147 --> 00:04:38,196
What?

49
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:39,387
The Pledge, Master. I didn't-

50
00:04:39,387 --> 00:04:41,286
Are you an idiot, boy?

51
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:44,633
The Angels decide who is innocent.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,668
But the scripture, Master!

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,160
“And the Angels saw that his evil-"

54
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Stop quoting scripture at me, boy!

55
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,000
I understand the scriptures.

56
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,000
I understand the Church.

57
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You must not use the Blood.

58
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Ever.

59
00:05:04,843 --> 00:05:08,151
So if there's a next time, you just want
me to lie down and die?

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why aren't you in chains right now?

61
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:18,620
Because what I-
Because what I did was-

62
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:24,870
“All who follow the Light shall shun him,
and bring him before the Angels for his
judgement and cleansing.”

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,563
Did your reading skip that verse, Jered?

64
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,053
Have you seen any of your guards
since the raid?

65
00:05:33,596 --> 00:05:34,373
Benedict?

66
00:05:34,679 --> 00:05:40,000
Captain Benedict was unconscious.
At least, that is what he claims.

67
00:05:40,704 --> 00:05:45,920
However - Albrect, Bartel, Mannet.
All saw you clearly.

68
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:47,603
Master, what are you-

69
00:05:47,603 --> 00:05:50,805
And you will not see them again in this life.

70
00:05:54,917 --> 00:06:02,039
Mannet's son is called Jered, I believe.
Think about him the next time you
decide to be a hero.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,776
The Church cannot have one of its own
exposed as Blooded, Jered.

72
00:06:14,776 --> 00:06:18,229
I wish things were not as they were,
but they are.

73
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:21,062
I understand, Master.

74
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:27,358
What are they?

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,009
The unclean, who will be
delivered unto the Angels.

76
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,508
But they aren't all-

77
00:06:32,608 --> 00:06:34,490
They have all been tested.

78
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:35,127
But that girl's-

79
00:06:35,576 --> 00:06:36,536
She's not-

80
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,644
She's the one they were going to sacrifice!

81
00:06:39,679 --> 00:06:42,163
That girl is the reason they were gathered.

82
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,466
The ceremony was her initiation
as a Blood Witch.

83
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:52,138
If the Church knew of your power,
you would be in those cages with them.

84
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:55,418
Another filthy Blooded to be cleansed.

85
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,918
You have been lucky, boy.

86
00:06:59,222 --> 00:07:00,923
Luckier than she was.
