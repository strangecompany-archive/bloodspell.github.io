1
00:00:09,854 --> 00:00:11,452
Arianne's up there?

2
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:13,120
If she's anywhere.

3
00:00:14,086 --> 00:00:15,974
Anyone with power is stored on the Spire.

4
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,699
With his arm, my uncle would
have torn him to pieces.

5
00:00:21,183 --> 00:00:23,368
But you people have it now, don't you.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:25,566
I don't think they're my people anymore.

7
00:00:25,707 --> 00:00:26,708
'Ware the boy!

8
00:00:26,792 --> 00:00:28,121
Don't let him escape!

9
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:43,821
What are your intentions towards my niece, boy?

10
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:44,342
What?

11
00:00:44,612 --> 00:00:46,118
I won't have her heart broken.

12
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,650
What on earth are you talking about?

13
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,709
Look, we need to get -

14
00:00:53,976 --> 00:00:54,590
Oh.

15
00:00:55,457 --> 00:00:57,268
What do you mean, what am I talking about?

16
00:00:57,368 --> 00:00:59,039
The two of you were, you know-

17
00:00:59,039 --> 00:00:59,913
(whistles)

18
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:01,576
-with her, outside in the street.

19
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:04,375
Yeah!  M- Magic! You-  It was about the magic!

20
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,672
She just needed to-

21
00:01:05,919 --> 00:01:07,425
L-look, nothing else, I promise-

22
00:01:07,425 --> 00:01:09,329
Nothing else?
Are you saying you don't fancy her?

23
00:01:11,448 --> 00:01:13,501
I'm just here to rescue Arianne.

24
00:01:13,676 --> 00:01:14,270
Yeah?

25
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,663
We'll talk about this later, lad.

26
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,903
Bloody hell.

27
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,575
If I had a tenth of the power that's in here...

28
00:02:03,007 --> 00:02:04,158
It can't be this easy.

29
00:02:07,551 --> 00:02:08,737
The watch changes soon.

30
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:10,939
Where's that arm?

31
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:13,116
There!

32
00:02:13,843 --> 00:02:14,289
Gad!

33
00:02:14,497 --> 00:02:15,265
Gad, wait!

34
00:02:20,657 --> 00:02:22,009
Ah, there you are.

35
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,293
I thought I'd lost you...

36
00:02:24,393 --> 00:02:24,940
Wait!

37
00:02:25,828 --> 00:02:26,460
You're right.

38
00:02:27,594 --> 00:02:29,276
I can't believe this place is undefended.

39
00:02:29,509 --> 00:02:31,200
If you don't see nothing, nothing's there.

40
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,056
(clanking noises)

41
00:02:39,963 --> 00:02:41,973
I am whole.

42
00:02:45,293 --> 00:02:53,044
(rumbling)

43
00:02:57,024 --> 00:02:58,337
What the hell was that?

44
00:03:00,091 --> 00:03:01,131
What the hell was that?

45
00:03:01,279 --> 00:03:02,387
Forget about that.

46
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,245
What are those!?

47
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:09,557
Spirits of the dead.

48
00:03:10,222 --> 00:03:11,520
I've seen the like before.

49
00:03:11,922 --> 00:03:12,812
You... fought them?

50
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,412
No.

51
00:03:13,978 --> 00:03:15,474
I ran like hell.

52
00:03:24,278 --> 00:03:25,861
Perhaps I can call something up to fight.

53
00:03:27,049 --> 00:03:27,965
You have to get out.

54
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:29,774
They want me, not you, lad.

55
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:31,947
When I draw them off, you run for the door.

56
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,068
Absolutely not!

57
00:03:33,135 --> 00:03:33,994
I'm not going to abandon you-

58
00:03:34,094 --> 00:03:35,037
I know what I'm doing, lad.

59
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:35,911
Trust me.

60
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:39,078
If you die, Carrie will kill you.

61
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,022
Oi!

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,303
Over here!

63
00:04:08,606 --> 00:04:10,630
(lightning crackles and hums)

64
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:20,632
Don't just stand there, shut the bloody doors!

65
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:10,363
Guard change.

66
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,305
You're early.

67
00:05:11,816 --> 00:05:13,312
Yeah, the captain wants a word with you.

68
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,171
What about?

69
00:05:14,212 --> 00:05:16,088
I heard him talking about missing food rations.

70
00:05:16,408 --> 00:05:17,560
I'd hurry, if I were you.

71
00:05:17,561 --> 00:05:18,212
Yeah?

72
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:20,392
Well, I heard him talking about intruders.

73
00:05:20,784 --> 00:05:21,843
Brace, get over here.

74
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,877
Brace?

75
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:24,807
Gaaarh!

76
00:05:25,907 --> 00:05:27,325
Argh!

77
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,150
This'll be fun if there's another earthquake.

78
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,566
It happened when we took the arm.

79
00:05:39,837 --> 00:05:41,619
Let's hope no-one else wants to steal anything.

80
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:46,449
If you want your freedom,
take out the northern towers!

81
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:49,373
Urgh!

82
00:05:52,857 --> 00:05:54,096
(screams)

83
00:05:55,792 --> 00:05:56,987
Aaargh!

84
00:06:01,379 --> 00:06:01,685
Urgh!

85
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:03,862
Uhn!

86
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,038
(screams)

87
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:15,304
Unf!

88
00:06:26,315 --> 00:06:28,548
(wailing and screaming)

89
00:06:28,813 --> 00:06:30,239
(tearing noises)

90
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,158
Good luck.

91
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,065
(mechanical noises)

92
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:53,081
You're all free.

93
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:54,697
Where's Arianne?

94
00:06:57,187 --> 00:06:58,514
Thank the Light you're alright!

95
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,448
We came to rescue you, all of us-

96
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,536
Gad and Carrie and-

97
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,732
What is it?

98
00:07:05,209 --> 00:07:07,223
(footsteps approach)

99
00:07:10,122 --> 00:07:12,072
Don't move, scum.

100
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:24,448
Hello, Jered.
