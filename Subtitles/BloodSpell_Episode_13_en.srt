1
00:00:08,578 --> 00:00:11,524
You want to die for some Blooded whore,
you go right ahead.

2
00:00:11,917 --> 00:00:13,943
I don't think they're my people anymore.

3
00:00:15,856 --> 00:00:17,499
Where would the boy have gone?

4
00:00:18,257 --> 00:00:20,334
All the magic that the Church grabs
is locked up in that building?

5
00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:26,600
Anything they capture is never recorded
and never touched again.

6
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:29,341
You can retake your initiation.

7
00:00:29,697 --> 00:00:31,175
He's under my protection.

8
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:32,299
Urgh!

9
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,872
If you make the right choice Jered,
I will let this woman go free.

10
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,588
Otherwise...

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,048
She will die.

12
00:00:44,147 --> 00:00:46,626
How did you arrange that blackout, you old fraud?

13
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:47,997
Nothing to do with me, love.

14
00:00:48,852 --> 00:00:49,890
Carrie!

15
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:51,800
Rule of thievery.

16
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,024
Only take what you can run with.

17
00:00:59,628 --> 00:01:01,864
And get out before the guards arrive!

18
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:35,050
Oh, come on!  There's got to be a way out of here!

19
00:01:35,309 --> 00:01:36,333
A loose brick!

20
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,518
Something!

21
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,755
Leave me alone!

22
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:42,006
Won't you...

23
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:43,102
...just...

24
00:02:21,513 --> 00:02:22,765
Hi, Arianne.

25
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,666
Shall we go?

26
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:26,592
We have a problem.

27
00:03:27,812 --> 00:03:28,945
I can't fly.

28
00:03:29,481 --> 00:03:31,610
But if you had a really big shovel-

29
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:32,065
Jered.

30
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:33,843
Are there other tunnel entrances?

31
00:03:34,363 --> 00:03:36,198
Yes, but the tunnels have always been unstable.

32
00:03:36,198 --> 00:03:37,228
They'll never survive.

33
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,243
It's bad housekeeping, that's what it is.

34
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:43,051
Why, if I let my tunnels get all unstable
my mother would never-

35
00:03:43,051 --> 00:03:43,916
SHUT UP!

36
00:03:45,012 --> 00:03:46,038
Sorry...

37
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:47,509
Rope?

38
00:03:47,509 --> 00:03:49,072
It's a five hundred foot drop.

39
00:03:49,369 --> 00:03:50,198
Climb?

40
00:03:50,198 --> 00:03:51,341
Not in an earthquake.

41
00:03:52,258 --> 00:03:53,300
Prisoners!

42
00:04:01,432 --> 00:04:02,139
They're tiring.

43
00:04:02,369 --> 00:04:03,238
Think fast!

44
00:04:03,238 --> 00:04:06,439
Any time you have an idea, feel free to share.

45
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,808
We could go out through the cathedral.

46
00:04:09,169 --> 00:04:10,545
It's too heavily guarded.

47
00:04:10,596 --> 00:04:11,303
Not any more!

48
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:14,007
It's the only place the Master could have
taken his reinforcements from.

49
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,453
I knew there was a reason I rescued you.

50
00:04:18,577 --> 00:04:20,117
The cathedral!  Go!

51
00:04:23,941 --> 00:04:25,235
The traitor boy!

52
00:04:25,554 --> 00:04:26,259
Quaine.

53
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:29,678
Always a pleasure, Arianne.

54
00:04:33,547 --> 00:04:35,479
It'll be a pleasure to kill you...

55
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:36,504
You're welcome to-

56
00:04:36,504 --> 00:04:37,354
(splorch)

57
00:04:38,747 --> 00:04:40,790
Sort out your problems in your own time, lad.

58
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,540
Right now, RUN!

59
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,176
I like what we've done with the place.

60
00:05:11,781 --> 00:05:13,178
It can be rebuilt.

61
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:23,643
You still have the choice, Jered.

62
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:27,569
Leave here with me, and they all live.

63
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:28,870
Yeah, right.

64
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,895
It's your mates who are back there bleeding.

65
00:05:32,325 --> 00:05:33,388
Please, Master.

66
00:05:34,456 --> 00:05:35,909
I don't want to see you get hurt.

67
00:06:18,722 --> 00:06:22,460
Your footwork is improving, boy.

68
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,916
Stay there, Master Gad.

69
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:27,885
Or I will harm you.

70
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,920
It comes down to this in the end, Jered.

71
00:06:33,313 --> 00:06:34,880
You must make the choice.

72
00:06:36,793 --> 00:06:40,940
Will you come home and rejoin your brothers
in safety and in learning?

73
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:44,876
Or will you condemn yourself to endless
flight and the underworld,

74
00:06:44,876 --> 00:06:47,837
even if somehow you escape us today?

75
00:06:49,464 --> 00:06:50,898
And see my friends die?

76
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:52,573
Yes.

77
00:06:53,642 --> 00:06:54,936
That's not a choice.

78
00:06:55,404 --> 00:06:57,877
It is as real a choice as any you get in life, boy.

79
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,479
All right.

80
00:07:07,168 --> 00:07:08,002
You win.

81
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,275
I'll come back.
