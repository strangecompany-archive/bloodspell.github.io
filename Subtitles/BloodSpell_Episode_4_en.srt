1
00:00:12,304 --> 00:00:16,960
If the Church knew of your power,
you would be in those cages with them.

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,539
I said I'd save her.

3
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:27,411
'Ware the boy! Don't let him escape!

4
00:01:27,559 --> 00:01:28,485
Halt!

5
00:01:30,552 --> 00:01:31,688
I'm following the prisoners!

6
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,612
Stop him!  Get him!
After him!

7
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:21,707
You see Paul, the young folk of today
have no vim, no vigour, no lust for li-

8
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:22,303
Hey!

9
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,100
By the Light!

10
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:16,928
What has spilled its tainted fire here, My servant?

11
00:03:17,634 --> 00:03:20,280
Lord, I wish only to serve you.

12
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:22,785
Where is My sacrifice?

13
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,855
Are these My sacrifices?

14
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:29,315
You may not look on his grace.

15
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:30,184
 Leave.

16
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:37,215
I may not lie to you, Lord.

17
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,035
We have no sacrifice.

18
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:44,628
Then you have no further use for
My blessings, My servant?

19
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,257
We apologise most humbly, Lord.

20
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:54,452
On the next sacrifice day, we will pay you
this sacrifice thrice over what was to be here.

21
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,161
Three times?

22
00:03:57,234 --> 00:03:59,749
The sacrifice was promised today.

23
00:04:00,172 --> 00:04:04,041
Yes, my Lord. But-
We were attacked.

24
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,119
Of course you were.
You cannot hide such things from Me. 

25
00:04:08,944 --> 00:04:10,241
Yes, my Lord.

26
00:04:10,455 --> 00:04:16,177
You were smote with tainted fire.
By this... man-child.

27
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:20,049
You will bring him as your sacrifice.

28
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:22,297
Lord, I-
I am not-

29
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:23,584
What is his name?

30
00:04:29,905 --> 00:04:32,561
I fear we do not know his name, my Lord.

31
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:34,304
No matter.

32
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:38,351
You will bring him to Me, will you not?

33
00:04:38,603 --> 00:04:39,928
Yes, my Lord.

34
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,335
We will.

35
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:57,334
I say!
Surely it isn't Thursday yet?

36
00:04:57,391 --> 00:04:58,959
Wh- Where are the privvies?

37
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,877
Thanks!

38
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,575
It would kill you to have a window?

39
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,094
Hey!

40
00:05:41,103 --> 00:05:43,369
You're that fellow the Monks are chasing!

41
00:05:43,569 --> 00:05:44,544
In here!

42
00:05:53,596 --> 00:05:55,260
Where did he go?

43
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,159
Uh?

44
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:57,421
The heretic.

45
00:05:57,973 --> 00:05:58,534
Answer me!

46
00:05:59,055 --> 00:06:00,870
He's in my bed.
