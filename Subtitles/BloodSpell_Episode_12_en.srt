1
00:00:10,652 --> 00:00:11,527
It could have been me!

2
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:12,415
No!

3
00:00:18,169 --> 00:00:19,323
'Ware the boy!

4
00:00:19,323 --> 00:00:20,657
Don't let him escape!

5
00:00:20,852 --> 00:00:22,876
This'll be fun if there's another earthquake.

6
00:00:23,087 --> 00:00:24,351
It happened when we took the arm.

7
00:00:24,504 --> 00:00:26,407
Let's hope no-one else wants to steal anything.

8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:28,551
Good luck.

9
00:00:31,761 --> 00:00:33,127
We came to rescue you, all of us-

10
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:34,254
Gad and Carrie and-

11
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:35,487
What is it?

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,838
(footsteps approach)

13
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,888
Don't move, scum.

14
00:00:49,974 --> 00:00:51,207
Hello, Jered.

15
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:53,068
So now you've come to kill me.

16
00:00:53,369 --> 00:00:55,087
I'm not here to kill you.

17
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,373
I've spoken to the cardinals on your behalf.

18
00:00:58,845 --> 00:01:00,900
You can retake your initiation.

19
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,818
(trapdoor creaks open)

20
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:45,918
Oh, shit.

21
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:47,688
They may still be up there.

22
00:01:48,055 --> 00:01:49,695
Kill anyone you find.

23
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:57,842
You're in trouble now...

24
00:02:01,561 --> 00:02:02,812
Sorry, sarge.

25
00:02:02,862 --> 00:02:04,196
Guess they've bugged out.

26
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:06,756
Settle in then.  We've got a long watch.

27
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,815
Great.

28
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,288
(sighs)  What now?

29
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:24,466
I won't do it.

30
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,232
Boy...

31
00:02:25,232 --> 00:02:26,969
These people saved my life!

32
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,129
I won't condemn them!

33
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:31,287
Their damned mothers condemned them
when they brought them into this world.

34
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,924
Those who are unclean are claimed by the Angels.

35
00:02:37,287 --> 00:02:38,407
Then so am I!

36
00:02:38,407 --> 00:02:39,879
Keep your voice down, boy!

37
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:41,366
I can't protect you forever.

38
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:46,167
You have very little choice in this matter, Jered.

39
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:49,152
Your alternatives are substantially worse.

40
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:51,086
He's under my protection.

41
00:02:53,145 --> 00:02:53,946
Urgh!

42
00:02:55,502 --> 00:02:56,401
Really.

43
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:03,801
If you make the right choice, Jered,
I will let this woman go free.

44
00:03:04,746 --> 00:03:08,576
Otherwise, even if you escape, she will die.

45
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,865
Hello, boys.

46
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:27,924
If there's anyone else up there...

47
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,423
I could use some help.

48
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:37,780
Come, Jered.

49
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,995
You wanted the opportunity
to make your own choices.

50
00:03:41,577 --> 00:03:42,551
Here we are.

51
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,402
Choose.

52
00:03:45,397 --> 00:03:46,626
Why are you doing this?

53
00:03:47,689 --> 00:03:49,437
You know we cannot let you go.

54
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:52,172
But any other initiate who'd ran away...

55
00:03:52,172 --> 00:03:53,408
Would already be dead.

56
00:03:55,017 --> 00:03:56,433
You've spoken to the cardinals.

57
00:03:56,796 --> 00:03:58,222
You've covered up my magic.

58
00:03:58,222 --> 00:03:58,913
But why?

59
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:00,056
You-

60
00:04:01,817 --> 00:04:03,006
You are important.

61
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,243
Make the choice, Jered.

62
00:04:06,907 --> 00:04:08,820
Your time is not unlimited.

63
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,719
On my command...

64
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:14,179
(crossbows creak)

65
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,795
(rumbling)

66
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,739
Well now, Master.

67
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,330
I can't see your beloved crossbowmen.

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,096
That rather implies that they can no longer see-

69
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:35,866
Wait!

70
00:04:37,384 --> 00:04:39,374
Get out of their way, Jered.

71
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,517
That's good advice, Jered.

72
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,077
It's an honour just to stand here.

73
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:50,679
Alone with the head of the Black Order.

74
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:55,641
Who wouldn't give his fortune for an
opportunity to discourse together like this?

75
00:04:56,064 --> 00:04:57,160
Just you...

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,659
...me...

77
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,953
...and my friends.

78
00:05:02,258 --> 00:05:02,992
Hmm.

79
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:06,109
<i>Salek.</i>

80
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,517
He's a blood mage!?

81
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:19,447
Marvellous!

82
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,635
Arianne, you are a wonder.

83
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,438
Even on the Spire you...

84
00:05:26,862 --> 00:05:30,265
I'd be so disappointed to feel you
were ignoring me, Arianne.

85
00:05:32,121 --> 00:05:33,798
Never, Demoncaller.

86
00:05:34,187 --> 00:05:36,333
Jered, how did you get into the fortress?

87
00:05:37,023 --> 00:05:38,382
The Black Monks' tunnels.

88
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,532
Can you lead us back there?

89
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:40,268
Of course.

90
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:41,113
Good.

91
00:05:41,913 --> 00:05:46,216
Karak, your people have to disperse the mob
down there, so we can lower the cages.

92
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,062
Have your boy do it.

93
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:51,375
I'm sure he's strong enough, isn't he.

94
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,749
Now, Karak.

95
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,705
What a fetching neckchain the boy's wearing.

96
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:59,515
I own something very similar.

97
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:14,379
Sarge, I swear I heard something.

98
00:06:14,997 --> 00:06:16,394
Relax, private.

99
00:06:16,494 --> 00:06:19,059
He's one man.  What can possibly go-

100
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:19,793
(splorch)

101
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,127
(roars)

102
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:22,395
(hisses)

103
00:06:24,972 --> 00:06:31,616
(screams)

104
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:33,347
Gad!

105
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,944
Lower the cage!

106
00:06:42,579 --> 00:06:43,118
(clang)

107
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:48,656
(shrieks)

108
00:06:51,888 --> 00:06:52,353
(argh!)

109
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:55,577
(urgh!)

110
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:56,371
(roar)

111
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,810
(roar)

112
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,436
Ah...

113
00:07:23,717 --> 00:07:25,011
Good work, lad.

114
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:26,688
Thanks.

115
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:28,694
Heartwarming, boys.

116
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,701
How did you arrange that blackout,
you old fraud?

117
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,091
Nothing to do with me, love.

118
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,994
I was stuck here with Sergeant Enthusiastic's
quarrel halfway up my arse.

119
00:07:37,336 --> 00:07:39,482
Don't worry, I'll never let on.

120
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,200
That quake earlier...

121
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:43,993
That wasn't you either?

122
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,242
Aye.

123
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:47,513
It was.

124
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:50,263
We were taking my arm from that...

125
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:51,980
Pyramid.

126
00:07:52,823 --> 00:07:53,610
Carrie!

127
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,719
Well, I guess it worked.

128
00:08:08,523 --> 00:08:11,210
Sorry, boys.  Rule of thievery.

129
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:13,306
Only take what you can run with.

130
00:08:18,578 --> 00:08:21,186
A-And get out before the guards arrive.
